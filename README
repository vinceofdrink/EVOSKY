/*
 * PROJECT INTEND TO WORK ON ATMEGA128 WITH F_CPU AT 11059200 (Crystal AT 11.0592MHZ) AND ROYAL EVO 7,9,12 FIRMWARE 1.41
 * I DID NOT TEST FOR REAL ROYAL 7 AND ROYAL 12
 *
 * BASIC FUNCTION ARE
 * DECODE ROYAL_EVO DATA AND GENERATE ACCORDINGLY A  PPM OUTPUT FOR FRSKY MODULE
 * DECODE FRSKY TELEMETRY DATA AND TRANSLATE THEM TO ROYAL EVO TELEMERTRY DISPLAY
 * DECODE A PPM INPUT FROM A FPV HEAD TRACKER AND ASSIGN THEN TO ANY OF THE TRANSMITED CHANEL
 *
 * THE TELEMETRY SHOULD BE EASYLY MODIFY TO MEET YOUR NEED
 *
 * I USE ECLIPSE (BASIC VERSION WITH C) AND A VERY CONVENIANT PLUGINS "AVR Eclipse Plugin" TO EDIT THIS PROJECT
 * YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO COMPILE WITHOUT ECLIPSE BY ENTERING "Release" FOLDER AND RUN "make all" IF YOU HAVE INSTALLED AVR ENVIRONEMENT
 * THEN YOU SHOULD BURN THE RESULTING "multiplex.hex" FILE WITH AVRDUDE OR USING THE AVRUBD UPLOADER IF YOU HAVE
 * CHOOSE FIRST TO BURN ATMEGA128 WITH THE AVRÂ°UNIVERSAL_BOOT LOADER PROVIDE WITH THE EVOSKY PROJECT
 * ex with USBASP Programmer "avrdude -pm128 -cusbasp -Uflash:w:multiplex.hex:a"
 * You should also programe The fuse for the first use with the following param
 * ex with USBASP Programmer "avrdude "
